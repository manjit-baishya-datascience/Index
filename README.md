# Data Science Portfolio - Manjit Baishya

Welcome to my GitHub repository index for data science projects! I'm Manjit Baishya, an aspiring Data Scientist from the beautiful city of Guwahati, Assam, India. Although I completed my B.Tech in ECE from Gauhati University, I'm now excited to dive into the fascinating field of Data Science.

This document serves as a centralized hub for all my open-source data science work on GitHub. I'm on a journey to develop my skills, and I document my progress through projects on LinkedIn and GitHub. Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out with any questions or suggestions. If you like any of my projects, please consider giving them a ‚≠ê star.
